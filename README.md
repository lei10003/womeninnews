### Visualizing the representation of women across news outlets around the world.

PLEASE FIND THE FINAL APPLICATION IN THE "final_app" FOLDER. PLEASE IGNORE THE "visualization" FOLDER, WHICH IS JUST INTERMEDIARY CODE THAT WAS USED PRIOR TO PUTTING IT TOGETHER INTO THE FINAL APP. INSIDE THE "final_app" FOLDER, THE "index.html", "index.js" and "styles_light.css" ARE THE RELEVANT FILES.

THANK YOU
