### Visualizing the representation of women across news outlets around the world.

Please find the final application in the "final_app" FOLDER. Please ignore the "visualization" folder, which is just intermediary code that was used prior to putting it together into the final app. Inside the "final_app" folder, the "index.html", "index.js" and "styles_light.css" are the relevant files. 

Thank you.
