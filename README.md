### Visualizing the representation of women across news outlets around the world.

As observed in a lot of competitive and high paying fields, there is proven lack of representation of both women and racial minorities in newsrooms. This unbalance is reflected in the news articles that we read every day, where women are often described in ways that reinforce social stereotypes and deepen gender biases. Extensive reporting on this issue in different forms - open editorials, journal papers and academic articles - has pushed people to think about the exacerbating effect that news outlets is having on gender misrepresentation (reference). Still, many questions remain unanswered:

What is the extent of gender bias and polarity across influential news outlets?

How prevalent are specific topics around the topic of women across different countries?

What are the most commonly used words to talk about women in headlines across different countries?

What kind of words are used in conjunction with each other around the topic of women?

While news consumption can influence our perceptions, news headlines allow a piece to turn from an article to a story. Headlines are designed to be catchy, sensational and with the advent of 24/7 news cycles, anxiety inducing. They make an imprint on our minds. In this piece, we used data from more than 50,000 headlines from the news outlets of 4 different countries to illustrate how women are represented in news headlines around the world.
