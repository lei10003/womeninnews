            <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s observed in a lot of competitive and high paying fields, there is proven lack of representation of both women and racial 
            minorities in newsrooms. This unbalance is reflected in the news articles that we read every day, where women are often 
            described in ways that reinforce social stereotypes and deepen gender biases. Extensive reporting on this issue in different 
            forms - open editorials, journal papers and academic articles - has pushed people to think about the exacerbating effect that 
            news outlets is having on gender misrepresentation (reference). Still, many questions remain unanswered: <br> <br>

            <i>What is the extent of  gender bias and polarity across influential news outlets?</i> <br> <br>
            <i>How prevalent are specific topics around the topic of women across different countries?</i> <br> <br>
            <i>What are the most commonly used words to talk about women in headlines across different countries?</i> <br> <br>
            <i>What  kind  of  words  are  used  in  conjunction  with  each  other around the topic of women?</i> <br> <br>
               
            It is these grounds that inform this study. The idea that we are what we consume is the ground from which we rise. <br><br>

            While news consumption can influence our perceptions, news headlines allow a piece to turn from an article to a story. Headlines 
            are designed to be catchy, sensational and with the advent of 24/7 news cycles, anxiety inducing. They make an imprint on our minds.
            In this piece, we used data from more than 50,000 headlines from the news outlets of 4 different countries to illustrate how 
            women are represented in news headlines around the world. <br><br></p>

        <p class="description"> 
            News articles have the potential to define perceptions and shape the general public opinion around 
            different topics. At a time when women need allies more than ever before, news outlets can be a powerful partner in fostering 
            an unbiased public opinion about women. In practice, however, they are not.  <br><br>

            For a given news outlet, the chart below shows the amount of gender bias and polarity
            used in headlines of that outlet. Bubbles represent outlets, and are sized by the size of their audience. <br><br>
            
            For each headline we measure <b>polarity</b> by using sentiment analysis, a machine learning technique that is used to detect 
            emotional affect in text. In this analysis we chose to consider the emotional <b>strength</b> of each headline as a proxy for
            polarity (irrespective of whether the emotion is positive or negative). By aggregating the polarity scores of an outlet's headlines
            we can rank each outlet on the basis of their average polarity. <br><br>

            For each headline we measure <b>bias</b> by tracking the combined occurrence of gendered language and social stereotypes 
            usually associated with women. Gendered language includes gendered pronouns (i.e. she, her, mrs, mis etc.) and 
            gendered nouns (i.e. girl, spokeswoman, girlfriend etc.). Examples of words that we categorize as social stereotypes 
            are <b> slut </b>, <b>emotional</b>, <b>sensitive</b>, or <b>married</b>, among many others. By counting these co-occurrences 
            we are able to assign a gender bias score to each headline. For example, a recent headline by the <i>Daily Mail</i> reads:<br><br>
             '<b>Woman</b> reveals <b>she</b>'s thinking about dumping <b>her</b> boyfriend because of his close <b>female</b> friend'<br><br> 
            This headline would get a bias score of 4. Finally, by aggregating all headline scores by news outlet we rank each outlet from most biased to least biased.
